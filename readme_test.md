# Dentalink Code Challenge

This is a simple challenge where you can show all your skills. There are no rules, it's absolute open to however you want to solve it.

We also want to understand how talented are you figuring out the best possible solutions for a single problem.

##Â Schedule challenge

Index.html is a simple calendar structure (like Google Calendar) with no events rendered.

Given /js/data.json, which is already requested via AJAX in /js/app.js, render items on the corresponding day, in a way that overlapping events are re-arranged in columns.

An expected output can be found in /img/expected.png.

## How to run

Use any HTTP server to run the index.html.

**Python**

python -M SimpleHTTPServer

**PHP**

php -S localhost:8000

You can also use apache or nginx. Just serve static content.

## Tips
The key is not on the CSS. Each event can be an absolute positioned div.
